# ComputationPhysics_Fortran

This repository contains codes for elementary tasks useful in computationally modeeling a physics problem. Included in this repository are solutions for differential equations using the Runge-Kutta and Gaussian Quadrature methods.

Further included are Monte-Carlo programs and the Lagrange Interpolation technique
